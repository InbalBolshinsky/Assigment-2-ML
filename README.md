# Breast Cancer Classification ML Flow

## Objective
The **Breast Cancer Classification** project aims to apply machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. By training a model on a breast cancer dataset, the goal is to accurately predict the presence of cancer based on features like tumor size, shape, and texture. This project provides hands-on experience with data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation in the context of medical diagnostics.

## Skills Learned
- Proficiency in data preprocessing and feature engineering for machine learning.
- Experience in training and fine-tuning classification algorithms like ID3, KNN, and SVM.
- Understanding of performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) for model evaluation.
- Hands-on experience with Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the ML models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for experimenting and running the code.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for model training, validation, and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for visualizing data and model performance.
